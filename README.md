The following are just quick edits to make various plugins by Quxios work for RPG Maker MZ. If you would like an explaination for their usage, or the MV versions please visit https://quxios.github.io/plugins

To use these plugins you will need to use old style plugin commands from MV, which you can get by either converting a MV project to MZ and copying the command from that into yours. Or you can copy and paste the command manually from a MV file into a MZ. Once you have access to a command like this, you can copy, paste and edit it as necessary to use these plugins. This may change in the future if I find the time to update them.
